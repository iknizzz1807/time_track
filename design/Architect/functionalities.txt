A streak tracker to encourage daily tracking.
Display motivational messages for milestones, e.g., “Keep it up! You're on a 7-day streak!”
Show activity levels, such as "Novice," "Intermediate," or "Expert," based on total hours tracked for that activity.
Add a progress bar to visualize hours toward the "10,000-hour expert" milestone.
